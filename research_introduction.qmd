Below is the rationale statement for our research.

## ðŸ“„ Rationale Statement

Firstly, on behalf of all of us in Group 1 - welcome.

After careful consideration, we have collectively chosen to focus our research efforts on Business
Analytics, Data Science, and Machine Learning Trends. The primary motivation for selecting this
topic is that, in the long run, a deeper understanding of these areas will significantly strengthen our
professional expertise and career prospects. Among the various research options available, we
believe this theme holds the greatest potential for long-term impact as we pursue careers in the
business analytics and data science disciplines.

Our goal is to conduct thorough and insightful research that provides a reliable understanding of
the industryâ€™s landscape at large. As is outlined in the assignment description, we aim to explore
the most in-demand skills, examine how job descriptions have evolved in recent years, identify the
leading employers of both business analysts and data scientists, and to assess the career outlook
of these roles.

If approached strategically, the exploration will serve as a valuable resource, providing knowledge
we can revisit and build upon throughout our careers - even as the industry continues to evolve.

Sincerely,

**Team 1**
