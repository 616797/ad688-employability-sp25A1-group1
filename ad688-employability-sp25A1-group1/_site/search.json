These included unique identifiers (ID), URLs of job postings (URL, ACTIVE_URLS), and columns providing less granular versions of NAICS and SOC codes (NAICS2, SOC_3, etc.).\nThe rationale for dropping these columns was to enhance data efficiency and clarity, reduce the dataset size, and focus on the most granular and meaningful data.\n\n\n# Visualize missing data\nmsno.heatmap(df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Drop columns with &gt;50% missing values\ndf.dropna(thresh=len(df) * 0.5, axis=1, inplace=True)\n\n# Fill missing values safely\ndf[\"NAICS_2022_6\"] = df[\"NAICS_2022_6\"].fillna(df[\"NAICS_2022_6\"].median())\ndf[\"NAICS_2022_6_NAME\"] = df[\"NAICS_2022_6_NAME\"].fillna(\"Unknown\")\n\n\nHandling Missing Values:\n\n\nAs seen in the heatmap above, it reveals that the columns ACTIVE_SOURCES_INFO, MODELED_DURATION, and MODELED_EXPIRED contain significant missing values, suggesting potential data collection or extraction issues. Notably, DURATION and EXPIRED exhibit a moderate positive correlation (0.5), indicating that longer job durations might influence missingness in related columns.\nAdditionally, ACTIVE_SOURCES_INFO shows a strong negative correlation with other variables, implying a pattern where missing data in this column might coincide with gaps in others.\nIn contrast, columns like MSA, MSA_NAME, and LIGHTCAST_SECTORS have no missing values, providing a reliable foundation for further analysis. Addressing missing data in correlated columns through targeted imputation can prevent bias and enhance the accuracy of our analysis.\n\n\ndf = df.drop_duplicates(subset=[\"TITLE\", \"COMPANY\", \"LOCATION\", \"POSTED\"], keep=\"first\")\n\n\nRemoving Duplicates:\n\n\nTo maintain unique job postings, duplicates were removed based on job title, company, location, and posting date.\nThis ensured that each job opportunity was only represented once, preventing skewed analysis results.\n\n\n\nImpact of Data Cleaning\nThe data cleaning process resulted in a more streamlined and manageable dataset, eliminating redundancy and potential inconsistencies. This step set the foundation for accurate and insightful analysis in the subsequent phases of the project.\n\n\n\nüìå Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\n\nTop 15 Job Posting Industries\n\ntop_industries = df[\"NAICS_2022_6_NAME\"].value_counts().nlargest(15)\nfig = px.pie(\n    names=top_industries.index, \n    values=top_industries.values, \n    title=\"Top 15 Job Posting Industries\"\n)\nfig\n\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): application/vnd.plotly.v1+json\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 15 Job Posting Industries\n\n\nIn our analysis, we looked at the top industries with the most job postings to get a sense of where the demand is highest. The pie chart shows that 22.6% of the postings fall under the Unclassified Industry category, suggesting that many roles either span multiple sectors or lack clear classification. This made us consider the potential limitations in how industries are labeled in the data.\nWe also noticed a strong demand for skills in technology and consulting. For example, Custom Computer Programming Services made up 12.1% of the postings, while Management Consulting Services accounted for 11.3%. This highlights a significant need for both tech and management skills in today‚Äôs job market.\nInterestingly, several tech-focused industries, such as Software Publishers and Computer Systems Design Services, showed up prominently in the chart. This aligns with the growing demand for IT and consulting professionals, which didn‚Äôt surprise us given the ongoing digital transformation across industries.\nWe also found that finance and healthcare sectors have a notable share of job postings, indicating steady demand in these fields. On the flip side, areas like Accounting and Temporary Help Services had fewer listings, suggesting these might be more niche markets.\n\n\n\nMonthly Trend of Data-Related Job Postings by Role\n\n# 1.

To do this, we filtered the dataset to include only job titles containing keywords like ‚ÄúData Analysts,‚Äù ‚ÄúBusiness Intelligence Analysts,‚Äù and ‚ÄúData Engineers,‚Äù among others. After filtering, we converted the posting dates into a proper datetime format and created a new column to track monthly trends. We then grouped the data by month and job title to visualize how the demand for these roles evolved over time.\nThe stacked area chart we generated illustrates that the demand for data-related roles has shown a consistent upward trend, especially after mid-June 2024. One of the most noticeable patterns is the significant share held by roles such as Big Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Analysts, which suggests that organizations are increasingly seeking professionals who can handle large-scale data analysis and provide actionable insights.\nInterestingly, we observed that the demand for Data Analysts and Data Analytics Engineers also increased steadily, indicating a growing need for professionals who can not only interpret data but also manage the infrastructure required for analysis. This aligns with the broader industry trend of integrating advanced analytics into decision-making processes.\nWe also found that more specialized roles like Clinical Data Analysts and Customer Data Analysts are gaining traction, although they represent a smaller share of the total postings. This could imply that industries such as healthcare and customer analytics are gradually expanding their analytics teams.\n\n\n\nRemote vs.¬†On-Site Jobs (Data Roles)\n\nfig = px.pie(df_roles, names=\"REMOTE_TYPE_NAME\", title=\"Remote vs. On-Site Jobs\")\nfig.show()\n\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): application/vnd.plotly.v1+json\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote vs.¬†On-Site Jobs\n\n\nWe created a Pie Chart to explor the distribution of remote, on-site, and hybrid roles for data-related jobs. The chart shows that 73.8% of postings do not specify a preference, suggesting either data gaps or employer flexibility. Among specified roles, 20.4% are remote, indicating a strong demand for remote work. Hybrid roles account for 4%, while fully on-site roles are only 1.79%.\nThese findings suggest a clear shift towards remote and flexible work arrangements in the data field. Highlighting remote work skills could be advantageous for job seekers in this area.\n\n\n\nData-Related Job Postings Across the USA\n\n# üîπ Step 2: Aggregate Job Counts by State\njob_counts = df_roles[\"STATE_NAME\"].value_counts().reset_index()\njob_counts.columns = [\"state\", \"job_postings\"]\n\n# üîπ Step 3: Convert Full State Names to Abbreviations\njob_counts[\"state\"] = job_counts[\"state\"].apply(lambda x: us.states.lookup(x).abbr if us.states.lookup(x) else x)\n\n# üîπ Step 4: Create Choropleth Map\nfig = px.choropleth(\n    job_counts,\n    locations=\"state\",\n    locationmode=\"USA-states\",  # Correct location mode for US states\n    color=\"job_postings\",  # Color by job count\n    hover_name=\"state\",\n    color_continuous_scale=\"Viridis\",  # High-contrast color scheme\n    title=\"Data-Related Job Postings Across the USA\",\n    scope=\"usa\"  # Focus on the USA\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): application/vnd.plotly.v1+json\n\n\n\n\n\nData-Related Job Postings Across the USA\n\n\nWe created a Choropleth Map to understand the geographical distribution of data-related job postings across the United States. To do this, we aggregated the job counts by state and converted full state names to abbreviations to ensure consistency in the map. We then used a choropleth map to visualize how job postings are spread across different states.\nFrom the map, we can see that states like California, Texas, and Florida have the highest concentrations of data-related job postings, indicated by the brighter yellow shades. This pattern suggests that these states are major hubs for data-related roles, likely due to their large tech industries and the presence of major corporations.\nIn contrast, several states in the Midwest and some in the Mountain region show darker shades, indicating fewer job opportunities in data-related fields. This could imply either a lower demand for such roles or a smaller tech industry presence in those areas.\n\n\n\nIndustries Having Data-Related Roles\n\n# Get industries associated with these roles\nindustry_text = \" \".join(df_roles[\"NAICS_2022_6_NAME\"].dropna())\n\n# Generate word cloud\nwordcloud = WordCloud(\n    width=800, height=400, background_color=\"white\", \n    colormap=\"viridis\", max_words=100\n).generate(industry_text)\n\n# Display the word cloud\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nplt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation=\"bilinear\")\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.title(\"Industries Having Data-Related Roles\", fontsize=14)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this WordCloud, we aimed to identify the industries that most frequently offer data-related roles. We extracted industry names from the dataset, combined them into a single text string, and then generated a word cloud to visualize which industries appeared most often.\nFrom the word cloud, we can see that ‚ÄúUnclassified Industry,‚Äù ‚ÄúProgramming Services,‚Äù ‚ÄúConsulting Services,‚Äù and ‚ÄúInsurance Carriers‚Äù are some of the most prominent terms. The large size of these words suggests that these industries have a significant number of data-related job postings. This pattern highlights the growing importance of data roles in both tech-heavy sectors like programming and consulting as well as in more traditional fields such as insurance.\nOther notable industries in the word cloud include ‚ÄúComputer Systems Design,‚Äù ‚ÄúEmployment Placement Agencies,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDirect Health Services.‚Äù Their visibility suggests a broad demand for data professionals across diverse sectors, emphasizing that data analytics skills are valuable beyond just the tech industry.\nThis indicate that the demand for data roles is not limited to a few industries but is spread across both tech-focused and traditional sectors. This reinforces the idea that data skills are becoming essential across the board.\n\n\n\nüìå Key Findings\n\nIndustry Demand:\n\n\nProgramming Services, Consulting Services, and Insurance emerged as leading industries for data-related roles, indicating a widespread need for data skills beyond traditional tech sectors.\nThe prominence of Unclassified Industry suggests potential gaps in data classification or a diverse range of roles that do not fit into conventional categories.\n\n\nGeographical Distribution:\n\n\nCalifornia, Texas, and Florida were identified as major hubs for data-related jobs, while several Midwestern and Mountain states showed fewer opportunities.\nThis pattern suggests that professionals may find more job prospects by focusing on these high-demand states.\n\n\nWork Arrangement Preferences:\n\n\nA significant share of job postings preferred remote and hybrid roles, with over 20% specifically offering remote options.\nThe limited proportion of fully on-site roles reflects a broader shift towards flexible work models in the data industry.\n\n\nRole-Specific Trends:\n\n\nThere is a clear upward trend in demand for roles such as Big Data Analysts and Business Intelligence Analysts, highlighting the growing importance of both technical and analytical skills.\nSpecialized roles like Clinical Data Analysts and Customer Data Analysts are also gaining traction, indicating expanding opportunities in niche areas.\n\n\n\n\nüìå Conclsuion\nOur analysis revealed that the demand for data-related skills is both substantial and diverse, spanning multiple industries and regions across the United States. Key sectors such as tech, consulting, and insurance show the most significant opportunities, while states like California, Texas, and Florida lead in job postings.\nThe strong preference for remote and hybrid roles highlights the importance of flexibility in the current job market. Meanwhile, the consistent rise in demand for specialized data roles suggests a promising outlook for professionals equipped with both analytical and domain-specific skills.\nOverall, these findings suggest that focusing on high-demand industries, enhancing remote work capabilities, and acquiring specialized skills can significantly boost job prospects in the data field."
